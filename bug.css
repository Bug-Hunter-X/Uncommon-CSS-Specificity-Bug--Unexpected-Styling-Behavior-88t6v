The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special-class div {
  color: red;
}

#special-id div {
  color: green;
}

#special-id .special-class div {
  color: purple;
}

<div class="special-class" id="special-id">
  This text will be purple.
</div>
```

The issue lies in understanding how CSS specificity works.  While it seems intuitive that the most specific selector (`#special-id .special-class div`) should always win, there might be unexpected behavior if other stylesheets or complex inheritance is involved.  The `#special-id .special-class div` rule is indeed the most specific, but a poorly understood cascading order could override this, leading to unexpected colors.

This error is subtle because it doesn't cause a syntax error or prevent the CSS from working. The bug manifests only in the unexpected styling result.
