The solution to this type of problem is to understand and improve your CSS structure.  Here's how:

1. **Simplify and Organize:**  Use a CSS methodology (like BEM, OOCSS, SMACSS) to make your selectors more predictable and maintainable. This improves readability and reduces the chances of specificity conflicts.

2. **Be Mindful of Inheritance:** Consider how styles inherit from parent elements.  A more specific selector in a child element might be overridden by a less specific but earlier style inherited from an ancestor.

3. **Use Developer Tools:** Chrome DevTools or Firefox Developer Tools allow you to inspect the computed styles and understand why a specific selector is not producing the expected output.

4. **Proper Order:** Ensure your CSS styles are applied in the order of importance.  Later styles might override earlier ones, even if the later styles appear less specific.

5. **Avoid `!important`:** While the `!important` flag can override any selector, it's considered bad practice.  It makes CSS harder to maintain and debug. Try to fix it by adjusting the CSS and HTML structure, as it is a symptom of a deeper issue.

```css
/* bugSolution.css - Resolving the Specificity Issue */

div {
  color: blue; /* Default color */
}

.special-class div {
  color: red; /* More specific rule for class */
}

#special-id div {
  color: green; /* More specific rule for ID */
}

#special-id .special-class div {
  color: purple; /* Most specific rule */
}
```

In this solution, we've rearranged the CSS to correctly reflect the priorities; however, if the bug is more complicated, additional CSS restructuring might be necessary.
