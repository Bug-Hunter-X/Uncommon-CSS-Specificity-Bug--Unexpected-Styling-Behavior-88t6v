# Uncommon CSS Specificity Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to CSS specificity and cascading order. The issue occurs when a seemingly highly specific selector does not produce the expected visual outcome due to the complexity of style inheritance and the cascading nature of CSS.

## Description

The bug is characterized by unexpected styling results stemming from an apparent lack of selector specificity overriding. The root cause is often a misunderstanding of how CSS specificity and the cascading order interact in complex scenarios involving multiple stylesheets or nested selectors.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.css` to see the CSS code causing the problem.
3. Open `index.html` (or a similar file containing the relevant HTML) to observe the unexpected color of the text.
4. Examine `bugSolution.css` to find the possible solution and fix.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing the order and specificity of CSS selectors, ensuring that the intended styles are appropriately prioritized based on the rules of specificity and cascading. Understanding the inheritance from parent elements is crucial for resolving this kind of error. Sometimes, using the `!important` flag (though generally discouraged) might be needed for overriding, but always find a cleaner and more maintainable solution.
